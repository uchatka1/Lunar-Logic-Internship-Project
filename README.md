# Lunar Logic Internship Project
This is the code I created for the Lunar Logic internship application. It's what I call "Table Randomizer" - an app which assigns party guests to tables and allows for mixing them during several meals, so that the guests can sit with as many different people as possible.

The vanilla JS version is a simple verison of the task. It accepts a given array of employee names, so you can feed it your own list.
