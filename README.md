# Lunar Logic Internship Project
This is the code I created for the Lunar Logic internship application. It's what I call "The Party Randomizer" - an app which assigns party guests to tables and allows for mixing them during several meals, so that the guests can sit with as many different people as possible.

The vanilla JS version is a simple verison of the task. It accepts a given array of employee names, so you can feed it your own list. Code available in repository, a working version also available on my Replit: https://replit.com/@uchatka/Lunar-Logic-Internship-Task#index.js

A HTML/CSS/JS version is available on CodePen: https://codepen.io/uchatka/full/poPVerg. Until code is published, this version may be not fully functional.
