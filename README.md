# Lunar Logic Internship Project
This is the code I created for the Lunar Logic internship application. It's what I call "Table Randomizer" - an app which assigns party guests to tables and allows for mixing them during several meals, so that the guests can sit with as many different people as possible.

*Code will be available when the project is finished, right now it is just a big mess ;)*
